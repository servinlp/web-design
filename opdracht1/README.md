## Design priciples

These are the design principles that I tried to implement in this project.

- Strong visual hierarchies work best (of course)

Strong visual hierarchie is achieved by keeping a constant view. Left the title + navigation, right the projects. All the projects have the same layout, top left the title and bottom right the "more link" (the actual link is over the entire element).

- Clarity is job #1

Using large titles and clear buttons I tried to make the website as clear as possible. Thanks to the user tests I held a few problems with clarity are already resolved. For example the buttons of the slider are now more clear then they were before.

- Consistency matters

Consistency matters and strong visual hierachies work best are 2 priciples that work hand in hand. Because my hierachie is set from the start, it doesn't change at all (and stays consistent).

### Feedback - Desley

Not to clear that you can click on the thumbnails. Only way to know this was to hover over the thumbnail and see that
your cursor changes. You can edit this by adding a hover to the thumnail or/and by adding something like an arrow on it
that shows there is more.

Als the font-size of the subtext under 'Level 30 Wizards' is pretty small. Espacially compared to the title. The
navigation also has terrible contrast for the buttons that arent active.

The two buttons for the 'slider' where not noticed untill I mentioned them. This probebly because the icons are
relatively small compared to the button. The buttons also border the side section which has the same background color,
this makes it so that buttons blend in with the section if you don't focus on them.

### Feedback - James

The overall feeling James got was that it was very static. The fact that for now it was only one page was one of the
causes for this but also the lack of any transitions in the page made it feel somewhat still. So it needs to feel a bit
more alive.

We also discussed the `font-size` and `line-height` used for the title and intro text. Because the font-size of the
title was pretty huge the `line-height` of this element also increased at a rate that was probebly more then necesarry.
The `font-size` of the intro text compared to the title was also a bit to much. The text had a `font-size` of 1em. This
is fine for regular text but this is the intro text of the website. It should catch your eye at least a little bit.

An idea James had while I was explaining to him what my idea was for the project pages was to reuse the sidebar I
currently use. Now this holds the navigation with the page title and a small intro but on the sub pages this can easily
be reused to hold the information on the project. This would also greatly help with keeping a clear structure throughout
the website.
