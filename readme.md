# Web design

This repository is for the subject web design as part of the minor Web Development on the HvA.

For this project I designed a new portfolio specifically for 2 users. The first being Marijn. He was born spastic, this means that most (if not all) of his web use is done through the keyboard. The second is someone who is interested in hiring me as intern.
